# EGUI-Library-in-WPF

Library in WPF
Please write simple Library application using WPF (under windows)
Main screen Layout could be done using code-behind approach (discussed on the March lectures) - so you may start at the first Lab
Dialog Layout for Add/Edit dialog box must be done using MVVM approach (will be presented on the lecture 4thth of April)
Task should be presented on Desktop PC in the Lab
Main screen (to be done first)

In that phase application simply present data which it read from the text file (Student himself should define format of this file)
According to filter on the top of the list only part of the books should be presented

Add/Edit dialog (to be done using MVVM aproach)

double-click on the item in the list should raise second window (modal dialog) which allows editing of the item
pressing save writes result to the disk and returns to the list (filter should be preserved)
pressing add button on the bottom on the list should raise the same modal window, but instead of 'save' it should have 'add' button
design of the Add/Edit dialog should be done properly (and is part of the job)
